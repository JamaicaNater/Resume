= Smart Resume
WIP

== Description

The goal of this project is to solve an issue that that I am facing where-in I cannot list all the projects that I have worked on in a one page resume. Thus, I have created a smart resume application which will allow the user to select what position they are considering me for and filter down my relevant experience.

== Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/JamaicaNater/Smart-Resume.git`
* Seed your resume according to my example at `/db/init-db.js`
   ** Use the provided terraform script to deploy the resources to AWS/GCP.
      *** View the resources on the cloud with the respective URL
   ** Or run locally using `make up`
      *** From there, you can access the UI (http://localhost:5173) API (http://localhost:3000) and DB (mongodb://localhost:27017).
